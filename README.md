## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Built with mostly CSS, for crisp styling. And a some Js adding animations, and to make website dynamic.

Navigate to the various sections to find out: more about me, my projects and different ways to get in contact with me.


## Optimizations


In the beginning I had created a page for each sections, to further improve the UX I opted out of this and instead made separate sections within index.html. I feel that by doing this it allowed me to use progressive rendering by using Lazy loading technique to load the images on scroll using js. Which in turns allows the page to load faster.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
